# Yale-Financial-Markets
I took Yale's Financial Markets course taught by Dr Robert J. Shiller in November 2025. It dives deep into topics like risk analysis, corporate stocks, behavioural finance, etc. This repository contains summaries, quizzes, applied market analysis, reflections, and 2 projects, covering financial analysis of a real company and a portfolio backtest
